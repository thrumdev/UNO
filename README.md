## 🔥 News
- [04/2025] 🔥 The [training code](https://github.com/bytedance/UNO), [inference code](https://github.com/bytedance/UNO), and [model](https://huggingface.co/bytedance-research/UNO) of UNO are released. The [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bytedance-research/UNO-FLUX) will coming soon.
- [04/2025] 🔥 The [project page](https://bytedance.github.io/UNO) of UNO is created. The paper of UNO will be released on arXiv.

## 📖 Introduction
In this study, we propose a highly-consistent data synthesis pipeline to tackle this challenge. This pipeline harnesses the intrinsic in-context generation capabilities of diffusion transformers and generates high-consistency multi-subject paired data. Additionally, we introduce UNO, which consists of progressive cross-modal alignment and universal rotary position embedding. It is a multi-image conditioned subject-to-image model iteratively trained from a text-to-image model. Extensive experiments show that our method can achieve high consistency while ensuring controllability in both single-subject and multi-subject driven generation.


## ⚡️ Quick Start

## 🔧 Requirements and Installation

Install the requirements
```bash
## create a virtual environment with python >= 3.10 <= 3.12, like
# python -m venv uno_env
# source uno_env/bin/activate
# then install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then download checkpoints in one of the three ways:
1. Directly run the inference scripts, the checkpoints will be downloaded automatically by the `hf_hub_download` function in the code to your `$HF_HOME`(the default value is `~/.cache/huggingface`).
2. use `huggingface-cli download <repo name>` to download `black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev`, `xlabs-ai/xflux_text_encoders`, `openai/clip-vit-large-patch14`, `TODO UNO hf model`, then run the inference scripts.
3. use `huggingface-cli download <repo name> --local-dir <LOCAL_DIR>` to download all the checkpoints menthioned in 2. to the directories your want. Then set the environment variable `TODO`. Finally, run the inference scripts.

### 🌟 Gradio Demo

```bash
python app.py
```


### ✍️ Inference

- Optional prepreration: If you want to test the inference on dreambench at the first time, you should clone the submodule `dreambench` to download the dataset.

```bash
git submodule update --init
```


```bash
python inference.py
```

### 🚄 Training

```bash
accelerate launch train.py
```
